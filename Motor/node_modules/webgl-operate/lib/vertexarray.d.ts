 * only once on initialization and only a single VAO bind and unbind is required for a rendering pass.
 *
 * The VertexArray can be used wrapped around any VertexBuffer interface:
 * ```
 * export class ScreenFillingTriangle extends VertexArray {
 * // ...
 *     bind(index: GLuint): void { ... }
 *     unbind(index: GLuint): void { ... }
 *     draw(): void { ... }
 * }
 *
 * export class ScreenFillingTriangleVAO extends VertexArray<ScreenFillingTriangle> { }
 * ```
 *
 * With that the screen-filling triangle can be drawn as follows:
 * ```
 * this.someTriangleVAO.draw();
 * ```
